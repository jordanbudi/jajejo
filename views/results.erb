        It's a starry friday night, and you roll up to grab <%= @results.celeb %> in your <%= @results.car %>. After <%= @results.celeb %> compliments how ravishing you look in your Flatiron shift, you speed off into the distance, anticipating the night of your life. Your <%= @results.extremity %> shakes with anticipation, but you slowly relax, knowing that you have the greatest date in history planned out for the evening. 
        </p>

        <p id="mad-lib">
        You screech to a halt in front of <%= @results.restaurant %> and arrive to the fresh smell of <%= @results.pungent_scent %>. Chef <%= @results.restaurant_chef %> comes over and greets you, commenting on how stunning your date looks, and asks if you'll please take a look at the code for their most recent app. You politely decline, directing them instead to the 
        <%= @results.incredible_adjective %> Flatiron school website, where all code goes to flourish.
        </p>

        <p id="mad-lib">
        After a meal of <%= @results.food_choice %> and <%= @results.drink_choice %>, you thank <%= @results.restaurant_chef %> for the <%= @results.food_adjective %> meal, and prepare for the nightly event. <%= @results.other_celeb %> picks you up on a <%= @results.crazy_transportation %> and jets off to the next event. <%= @results.celeb %> stares longingly into your eyes and asks if you can play <%= @results.romantic_music %>, while you travel. After a lovely chat, stop and stare in wonder at what you have planned. It's time for <%= @results.activity %>!.
        </p>

        <p id="mad-lib">
        <%= @results.celeb %> is blown away by your attention to detail and says, "You're the most perfect date in the world." Right as that special moment hits, <%= @results.event %> happens. Knowing you have to salvage this perfect date, you rapid-fire code a program that takes you both right back home, ending the night in dramatic fashion. "Wow." <%= @results.celeb %> says, clearly bewildered. "I need to learn how to code."
          
        The end.
